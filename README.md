## How can I host generated websites on Ngrok?

This project includes a feature to host generated HTML websites on Ngrok for easy sharing and previewing.

### Setup

1. Make sure you have an Ngrok account and auth token (optional but recommended for persistent URLs)
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install express ngrok`

### Starting the Hosting Server

Run the hosting server in a separate terminal:

```sh
npm run server
```

This will start a local server on port 3001 and automatically create an Ngrok tunnel.

### Using the Feature

1. Generate a website using the AI assistant
2. Once the website is generated, you'll see a "Host on Ngrok" button
3. Click the button to upload the HTML to your Ngrok-hosted server
4. The URL will be displayed, which you can share with others
